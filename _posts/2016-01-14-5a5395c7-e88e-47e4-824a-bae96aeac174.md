Please consider joining [Metabedu community][0], explore it .  There is a mission and ideology there, or read them [HERE][1] .

You do not have to join to see most of what is at Metabedu, you do have to join to participate.

Rules? We're not particularly fond of religious dogma. In fact, past members have been atheists, so "Jesus is Lord!" can be rather divisive, though many members are Christian, some are Buddhist, Jewish, and more.  We are super appreciative of civil discourse so no name calling or degrading comments  and innuendo please.Current empowerment areas: 1) community endeavors/social justice; 2) personal growth & empowerment . This can be endeavors from new or existing community projects to meditation to learning circles, webinars, laughing circles and fun social sessions.  If you'd rather just "lurk"feel free to decline this invitation.  Maybe you will join at a later time or not.  From time to time administrators dissolve memberships for nonparticipation in posts and things. Not an indictment as much as a barometer of what is actually going on.  Metabedu was created to invite people to share gifts, possibilities, and opportunities for inside out empowerment.   Been scratched and now feel like being active? simply apply at Metabedu.

We anticipate you will encourage others to join you in what you are doing or interested in and take opportunities to join others. If you are on facebook we encourage "liking" Serendipity Cleveland.

Through being and duing (doing) with the unique mix of gifts here we will continue to impact the world starting with ourselves working from the inside out .
